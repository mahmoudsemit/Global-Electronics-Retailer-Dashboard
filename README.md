This project was intended to analyze the sales by individual store of a global electronics retailer and make an interactive sales dashboard. The questions answered through the analysis are as follows:

What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located?

Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume or revenue?

How long is the average delivery time in days? Has that changed over time?

 How much is the revenue from online vs. in-store sales?
